# Web-Development

>  **Following the Udemy - The HTML & CSS Bootcamp 2023 Edition Course.**

***What I learned in this Course:***

1. Basics of HTML: structuring documents, creating text elements, tables, and forms. Then I learned about semantic markup and creating accessible webpages.

2. Basics of CSS: working with selectors, color systems, and styling text elements.

3. CSS concepts including the box model, specificity, the cascade, and CSS units.

4. Learned about backgrounds, gradients, filters, positioning elements, working with transitions and transformations, and many other more intermediate CSS properties.

5. Created complex CSS layouts using Flexbox and CSS Grid.

6. Created responsive layouts that look good on all screen sizes, from large desktops to tablets and mobile devices.
